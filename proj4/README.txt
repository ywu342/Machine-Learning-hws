For this assignment I pulled in a local copy of BURPLAP project and implemented the analysis inside the package itself. I also added and modified some helper classes in the package so my analysis code may not work well with another copy of BURPLAP.

All the analysis is done within one class: burlap-master/src/main/java/mdps/MdpExps.java.
To run the analysis, import the whole "burlap-master" as a maven project in IDE and navigate to the "MdpExps.java" and hit run.
